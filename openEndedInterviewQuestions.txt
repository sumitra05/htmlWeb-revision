     We faced many challenges in the path to build the project, also we got many issues when merging the code. But as a team we handled every issue make sure that the project will be completed on time.

5) Why do coding standards matter? What are some patterns you follow?
Ans. Coding standards matter a lot when it comes to writing code, because using some simple standard makes your code easy to read, debug and also useful when it is actually used. It reduces risk of project failures.
     => Some patterns I follow are: 
            - Naming conventions for variable's, functions and classes. Should describe the reason of use,
            - Limiting global variables's and making use of const and let accordingly,
            - Indentation which increases readability of code,
            - Avoid use of if-else instead use functions,
            - functions should be small.

6) How do you go about managing responsive websites?
Ans.    => Focus On The Content.

        => Make Website “Touch-Friendly”
        => Pick The Right Content Management System (CMS)

7) What do you care about the most when you write software?
Ans. => Code should be readable and understandable
